# Reflection Question Responses (PerScholus)
1. How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?

  Using Figma allowed me to see more of the specifications and details of the project, such as font size and font color.
  It made things easier because I didn't have to guess.

2. What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?

  It was difficult trying to get the margins and padding correct. It was difficult to get my flexbox correct for my container. It was very time consuming.


3. How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a develop

  There is a community aspect to the website where you can ask questions about projects that you are working on. That is very helpful to a new frontend developer. They also have a discord where you can interact in real time with others who can help you or provide you with feedback about your projects.

## Overview

You will within the files, my solution to the Blog preview card challenge from Frontend Mentor.com. 
1. Download Starter Files: The challenge includes pre-written HTML and CSS starter code, simulating a real-world project    handoff. Download these files.
2. Download Figma Design File: Open the design in Figma to inspect elements as needed.
3. Review Documentation: Read through the README.md and style-guide.md files for design details, colors, and fonts.
4. Implementation: Open the starter code in VS Code, inspect the Figma file, and start implementing the design.

### The challenge

Build out Blog preview card to match the design as closely as possible. This simple component will help you practice aligning layout and style with a professional design.
Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I began with creating a container. Then I put all the elements inside of the container. Next, I did my styling in css. Finally, I worked to get all of the placements and spacing correct.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that there is more than one way to get to the solution but there is always a more efficient way to code
that improves the structural work flow and allows others to understand your work.

### Continued development

I will continue to develop my understanding of media queries and flexbox. I have a general understanding but there is so much more to explore within these topics.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowlegde Brian S. for helping me gain a better understanding of creating a skelton first. It really helped deepened my understanding and improved my work flow.
